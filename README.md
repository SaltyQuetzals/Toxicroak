# Toxicroak
Creating a natural-language model to identify different types of toxic comments on Wikipedia.

## Data
The data used in this model is _not_ included in this GitHub repository. It's located on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) for download.

## Setup
This guide assumes you have [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) installed. If you don't want to pollute your global Python environment, feel free to make a virtual environment.

1. Install the dependencies of this project using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
